## moving raw files

```
pwd # past working directory, find where you are
cd OG7591-691868198 # identify/move to to directory where raw RNASeq files are
cd ../nobackup # move back to nobackup folder
mkdir sourcefiles # make a new directory called 'sourcefiles'
cd sourcefiles
mkdir run # make a new directory for the raw reads
cd .. # move back to nobackup directory
cp ../OG7591-691868198/AA*/*gz sourcefiles/run/ # take all the files containing the letters/numbers in the asterix and copy them into the new run directory
```


## quality control

cd sourcefiles #if you aren't already in it
mkdir QC # make a folder called QC
cd run
module load FastQC/0.12.1 # load fastqc for quality control
fastqc -o QC/ run/* # perform quality control on the raw data
cd ../QC # move into the QC directory
for filename in *.zip # unzip fastqc text file outputs
    do
    unzip $filename
    done
cat */summary.txt > ~/nobackup.sourcefiles/QC/fastqc_summaries.txt # generate summary of QC stat tests to see where failures have occurred
module load MultiQC/1.13-gimkl-2022a-Python-3.10.5 # load MultiQC
cd .. # move back to sourcefiles
mkdir MultiQC # make a directory called 'MultiQC'
cd MultiQC
cp ../QC/* ./ # move all QC files for individuals samples into MultiQC directory
multiqc . # perform multiqc analysis
