Moving raw files

```
pwd                       # past working directory, find where you are
cd OG7591-691868198       # identify/move to to directory where raw RNASeq files are
cd ../nobackup            # move back to nobackup folder
mkdir sourcefiles         # make a new directory called 'sourcefiles'
cd sourcefiles
mkdir run                 # make a new directory for the raw reads
cd ..                     # move back to nobackup directory
cp ../OG7591-691868198/AA*/*gz sourcefiles/run/ # take all the files containing the letters/numbers in the asterix and copy them into the new run directory
```

Quality control

```
cd sourcefiles                # if you aren't already in it
mkdir QC                      # make a folder called QC
cd run
module load FastQC/0.12.1     # load fastqc for quality control
fastqc -o QC/ run/*           # perform quality control on the raw data
cd ../QC                      # move into the QC directory
for filename in *.zip         # unzip fastqc text file outputs
    do
    unzip $filename
    done
cat */summary.txt > ~/nobackup.sourcefiles/QC/fastqc_summaries.txt # generate summary of QC stat tests to see where failures have occurred
module load MultiQC/1.13-gimkl-2022a-Python-3.10.5 # load MultiQC
cd ..                         # move back to sourcefiles
mkdir MultiQC                 # make a directory called 'MultiQC'
cd MultiQC
cp ../QC/* ./                 # move all QC files for individuals samples into MultiQC directory
multiqc .                     # perform multiqc analysis 
```

Trimming (if fastqc and multiqc results indicate it is needed)
# this will use the cutadapt programme to trim low quality reads out of the files and put them into a new folder called 'Trimmed'

```
pwd
cd ..                         # move back to sourcefiles directory
mkdir Trimmed                 # make directory 'Trimmed'
module load cutadapt/4.1-gimkl-2022a-Python-3.10.5    # load latest cutadapt version
cd run                        # go to the raw data folder
for filename in *fastq.gz
    do
    echo $filename
    base=$(basename ${filename} .fastq.gz)
    cutadapt -j 4 -m 20 -q 20 -a AGATCGGAAGAG -o ../Trimmed/${base}.trimmed.fastq.gz ${filename} > ../Trimmed/${base}.log
    done
cd ../MultiQC
cp ../Trimmed/*log .          # take all the trimmed .log files
multiqc .                     # and run the multiqc again
