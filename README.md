Summary

We built the transcriptome of the estuarine triplefin (_Forsterygion_nigripenne_) and the common triplefin (_Forsterygion_lapillum_) denovo using Trinity. We then performed gene annotation using Trinotate and further downstream analyses in R Studio v4.3.0). Using this repository, the analysis should be entirely reproducible. The main output files are here.
